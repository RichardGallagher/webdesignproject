             What an honour it is to be the President of Ballyshannon RFC for the 2019-2020 season and It is with great pride and delight that I take up this privileged post. Over the years we have had some remarkable people,<br>
             The Mini and Youth sections continue to flourish and as we all know, this is the life blood of our club. The under 14’s won their league and were unbeaten in 16 games. The under 16’s achieved the double, winning all 14 league games and claiming the Ulster Carpets Cup at the Kingspan Stadium. Our under 18’s finished runners up in the league and won the Nutty Krust tournament for the third year in a row.<br>
             I wish our coaches, team managers, physios, volunteers and supporters, along with all our players, who put their bodies on the line week <br>in and week out whilst wearing the RedBlue and Black, a memorable, enjoyable and successful season with City of Armagh RFC.<br>
             <br>
             Yours in Rugby,<br>
             <br>
